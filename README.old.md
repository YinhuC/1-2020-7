- Need to restructure react router and use a single file for the location pages rather than a file for every location.
- Make the pages responsive
- Center the slide section on all screens
- Add above the slide section and under the header section
- The images are incorrect order and are placeholders for now
- Change the images resemble the location displayed
- Pass the image down from the marketing page?? from the slide section
